/**
 * Instances of the class FormatRecognizer are able to recognise the format of
 * files.
 * 
 * They determine the formats by either
 * <ul>
 * <li>parsing the files: {@link #getFormatByParsing (java.io.File,
 * java.lang.String)}</li>
 * <li>understanding a MIME-type: {@link #getFormatFromMime
 * (java.lang.String)}</li>
 * <li>recognising a file extension:
 * {@link #getFormatFromExtension (java.lang.String)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If one of the methods fail to determine the format they must return
 * <code>null</code>.
 * 
 * The priority determines the order we use to ask different recognizers.
 * Default recognizers have a priority of 100.
 * The first recognizer, which returns a valid format, determines the format to
 * be used.
 * If you ever need to change the priority of different recognizers you should
 * resort the recognizers
 * in the Formatizer class by calling {@link Formatizer#resortRecognizers ()}.
